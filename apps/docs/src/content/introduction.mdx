# Introduction

Color Kit is an open-source toolkit for building color interfaces. It provides:

- **`@color-kit/core`** — Pure TypeScript color utilities with zero dependencies. Conversions, contrast checking, harmony generation, scale creation, and gamut mapping — all built on the OKLCH color space.
- **`@color-kit/react`** — Headless, accessible React primitives for color pickers, sliders, swatches, and more. Completely unstyled so you can bring your own design system.

## Why OKLCH?

Color Kit uses [OKLCH](https://oklch.com/) as its internal color representation. OKLCH is a **perceptually uniform** color space, which means:

- Equal numeric steps produce equal _visual_ steps
- Gradients between colors look smooth and natural
- Color manipulation (lighten, darken, saturate) behaves intuitively
- It maps cleanly to modern CSS (`oklch()` is supported in all browsers)

Traditional color spaces like HSL produce uneven results — a "50% lightness" yellow looks much brighter than a "50% lightness" blue. OKLCH fixes this.

## Architecture

```
@color-kit/core          (zero deps, any JS runtime)
  └── @color-kit/react   (React 18+, peer dependency)
```

The core package works in any JavaScript environment — Node.js, Deno, Bun, browsers, edge functions. The React package depends on core and adds headless UI primitives.

# React Primitives

Color Kit React primitives are intentionally headless building blocks for design-tool workflows.

## What makes them "primitives"

- They own behavior and semantics, not visual branding.
- They expose deterministic requested/displayed contracts.
- They remain composable in controlled and uncontrolled setups.

## Typical composition

```tsx
import {
  ColorProvider,
  ColorArea,
  HueSlider,
  AlphaSlider,
  ColorInput,
  ColorStringInput,
  ColorDisplay,
} from '@color-kit/react';

export function Picker() {
  return (
    <ColorProvider defaultColor="#3b82f6">
      <ColorArea />
      <HueSlider />
      <AlphaSlider />
      <ColorInput model="oklch" channel="h" />
      <ColorStringInput format="oklch" />
      <ColorDisplay />
    </ColorProvider>
  );
}
```

## API design goals

- Stable, composable contracts.
- Intent preservation under gamut constraints.
- Accessibility-first interaction defaults.

## Next stop

Use the **Components** section to dive into each primitive's API, anatomy, and helper utilities.
